### Git Workflow Demo

We'll do a few things, today:

1. Clone this repository to your own computer
2. Create your own branch
3. Make some changes
4. Publish your branch
5. Issue a Pull Request

In our second session, we'll extend our work with [Blueprints](http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/blueprints) by looking at the forms they create within the [Panel](http://getkirby.com/docs/panel), and how to use the information we enter in [Templates](http://getkirby.com/docs/templates).
