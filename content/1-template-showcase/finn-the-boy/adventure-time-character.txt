Info: 

As revealed in "The Visitor" by Finn's biological father, Martin, Finn was supposedly born in a "banana boat" in the middle of the ocean, where he nearly fell prey to a host of sea-creatures (and a Tiger, by Martin's recollection). However, since Martin seems to be confused when recalling Finn's birth, it is uncertain whether or not his memory is accurate.

As shown in "Memories of Boom Boom Mountain," Finn appears to have been abandoned in the woods during infancy. He reveals that he made "boom boom" (Finn's word for defecation) on a large leaf and fell on it. He lay there crying until Jake's parents, Joshua and Margaret, rescued him from the wilderness and brought him to their home. They raised him alongside Jake, who, along with Jermaine, became Finn's adopted brother.

It is revealed in "Susan Strong," that Finn knows nothing of his human parents or any other humans. In "Henchman," Finn states that Jake told him that he originated from a cabbage as a joke. However, Finn later learns about his biological father, Martin, in the episode "Billy's Bucket List."
